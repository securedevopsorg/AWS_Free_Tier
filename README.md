# AWS_Free_Tier
AWS examples and samples re-factored within AWS Free Tier constraints

All Free Tier, All the time. Nothing in here will exceed the maximums specified in the AWS Free Tier.

The problem: AWS automation examples/samples often include settings for deployment which exceed AWS Free Tier maximums. This is because AWS sample templates are designed to be used as 'deployment' templates for real world applications and not simple demonstrations or testing.

The solution: Modify the templates with instance sizes that do fit within AWS Free Tier constraints.

WARNING! Do not use these in production! They will certainly fail to deliver any real world use levels of performance!
